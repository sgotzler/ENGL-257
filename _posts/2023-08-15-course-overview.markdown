## Video Games and Narrative Cinema

### Course Overview

###### In this hands-on gaming course, students will decipher the narrative design of video games while exploring the legacy of cinema to gameplay. They will also apply critical gaming concepts (agency, flow, point of view, authorship, representation, narrative choice, loops) to evaluate cinema as a ludic and participatory artform beyond conventional narrative elements. 

###### We will approach our study of video games and cinema through three interconnected frameworks: narrative, re-mediation, and adaptation. First, we’ll examine games and films as the historical products of discrete media industries. We’ll look into the history of cinema and digital gaming alongside readings in media theory that will help us analyze films and video games as texts that often disclose divergent narratives of technology. Next, we’ll interrogate the ways that the narratives of video games and films negotiate, subvert, or reproduce, historical patterns of violence, dispossession, and power. To ground our discussions historically, we’ll examine a sequence of games and films that re-mediate the memory and experience of settler-colonialism in North America. Finally, we’ll spend some time exploring the adaptive exchanges across these different media as features of their narrative form and gameplay. Looking to select readings in critical theory, computer science, and eco-criticism we’ll conclude the course by thinking about the theory and design of interactive environments (in games, and in films) as indicative of particular strategies for rendering environmental flows, social relations, and speculative temporalities.

###### We will watch influential films from a variety genres and historical periods including horror, science-fiction, thrillers, and westerns drawn from across the silent era, classic Hollywood, and contemporary blockbusters. During each unit, we will also engage in critical play sessions to explore select game titles, and view and discuss gameplay footage from a host of others. Games played in the course will include *INSIDE* (2016), *The Oregon Trail* (1985), *Red Dead Redemption 2* (2018), *Never Alone - Kisima Inŋitchuŋa* (2014), and *Death Stranding* (2019). Other games to be viewed and discussed may include: *Rom Check Fail!* (2013), *Lemmings* (1991), *Pony Island* (2016), *Pokemon: SNAP!* (1999) *Mad Max* (2015), *Cyberpunk 2077* (2020), *Dune: II* (1992).
