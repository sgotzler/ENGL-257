### Assignments & Expectations

Below you will find a detailed outline of the assignments and expectations for the course.

#### Viewings and Readings

The foundation of everything we do in this course will be our weekly film viewings, readings, and gameplay sessions.

Each week our recitation section time in the Gameroom will be used to facilitate extended play of featured titles. To facilitate this, we will work in small groups to play, watch, and discuss these titles at the 5 gaming stations. TA’s will facilitate play-sessions, and from time to time may lead short critical discussions. In addition to gameplay sessions held during recitation sections, will be watching nine feature length films—some exceeding 120 minutes in runtime. As such, students will be responsible for viewing the film for each week closely and in its entirety prior to attending class. We will also be regularly viewing video capture of gameplay footage from a variety of games (10-15min each) that will form the basis of our in-class discussions. 

Critical and scholarly sources will be excerpted, and uploaded to Canvas. In general, the materials for each week will be paired with a single required reading, and during unit 3 (weeks 10-13), short YouTube videos on game design principles may also be assigned. Throughout the term, optional readings may also be uploaded to the canvas site, these are not mandatory and will not be central to our in-class discussions. That being said, students are encouraged to examine or skim optional readings at their discretion and according to their inclination, as many may be helpful for developing their video essays. 

**NOTE:** Depending on availability, I may also hold live streams on twitch during select evenings outside of class — in the event that these streaming sessions do occur they would be entirely optional, and participation or viewing of them would have no impact on a student’s grade.

*Expectation and Effort*: Students will be expected to complete a regular weekly viewing load of anywhere between 90-150 minutes of films and gameplay capture footage, and complete assigned reading between 15-30 pages. 

The best way to ensure that you earn a successful grade, and have the most meaningful learning experience, is to complete the weekly viewings on time and the examine the readings ahead of discussion. Demonstrating, on a weekly basis, that you’ve made a consistent effort to meaningfully engage with the course viewing and reading materials is the mechanism for the “participation and course contributions” grade in this course, (see below).

#### Critical Play Journals

In this course, we will be keeping play journals. These journals will be created and maintained individually by each student, and are designed to provide a space for students to engage in deliberate guided reflection and practical experimentation. Throughout the term students will use their journals to document their experiences of critical play, and venture provisional responses to prompts shared by the instructor each week, these will consist of a mixture of critical reflection questions, and comparative observation exercises guided by the films that we watch each week. 

At the conclusion of each unit students will then use their journal entries (whether as responses to instructor prompts, or as direct observations of the gameplay experience) to compose a brief critical play essay (400-500 words) engaging with the broad themes of the course, and the analytical focus of that unit in particular. These short essays will provide a space for students to develop insights that may inform their video final projects and tackle core writing tasks related to the video essay assignment.

*Expectations and Effort*: there are no set expectations for student’s week-to-week journal entries, as this is a personal space for them to generate insights, and brainstorm ideas. 

However, the critical play essays should conform to a range between 400-500 words. They should make use of salient textual details drawn from the films and games from that unit as evidence, and they should offer some kind of analytical claim, even if only a provisional or suggestive one.

Play Journal essays will be assessed 3 times throughout the semester in weeks 5, 9, and 14.

#### Pink Time: Self-Directed Mid-Term

In this course, we will utilize a pedagogical tool called “Pink Time” – I’ll say more about this prior to our first engagement with it, but in brief, PINK TIME is a teaching strategy designed to enable self-directed activity that enhances both student engagement and learning outcomes by emphasizing autonomy, mastery, and purpose (it is an approach whose effectiveness is evidence-based, not just hooey!)— https://www.pinktime.org/ 

Each time that we engage in Pink Time, students will produce a brief —and honest—reflection and assessment of their work, and assign themselves a grade. Ideally, these 3 sessions could build organically upon each other and might add up to a coherent experience – though they might diverge as well, and represent several different avenues of exploration which you tried out during the term.

*Expectation and Effort*: What it means in practice, is that twice over the course of the semester instead of holding our normal class session, and in lieu of preparing and attending class (i.e., for approximately 3-4 hr.), you will each engage in a self-directed learning activity related to video games and narrative cinema. 

**For Example:** exploring related topics that interest you online, conducting further reading in the history and criticism of cinema or game studies, organizing and hosting a game night and leading a critical discussion for participants afterward, producing creative content for campus or social media communicating insights from our course, spending some time on twitch.tv and writing a critical reflection afterwards, watching a film closely and generating a description of its formal features, or simply firing up a video game for a couple of hours and reflecting on your experience of play—or, indeed, anything else that you can imagine!—these are just some ideas, the point is that you decide how to invest your time and that you give yourself free reign to be as creative in those pursuits as you wish.

Pink Time sessions will be held in weeks 5 and 10.

#### FINAL: Video Essay Project

The capstone assignment for this course will be a video essay project that we will screen together as a class at the end of the semester and publish online. These essays will showcase our various explorations of, and interventions in, the study of video games and narrative cinema. 

Students will use these video essay project to make original arguments about the interpenetrated histories, forms, and/or genres of video games and narrative cinema, drawing on primary sources drawn from the course syllabus and conducting secondary research on their own. In the process, we will work together to craft visual arguments about the visual media examined in the class.

Throughout the semester we will scaffold this assignment with additional technical instruction and tutorials, by viewing and analyzing other video essays as models, and working in groups to provide feedback and advice on composition, editing, and revision of these projects. 

*Expectation and Effort*: These finished video essays should be 5-7min in length, must utilize a minimum of 3 secondary sources drawn either from the course syllabus or independent student research, and should engage in analysis of both video games and films as primary sources.

Instruction during weeks 5, 13, 15 and 16 will be dedicated solely to developing these video essay projects.
