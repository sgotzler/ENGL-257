### **Video Essay Projects**

###### The capstone assignment for this course is a video essay project that we will screen together as a class at the end of the semester. These essays will showcase our various explorations of, and interventions in, the study of video games and narrative cinema. 

###### Students will use these video essay projects to make original arguments about the interpenetrated histories, forms, and/or genres of video games and narrative cinema, by drawing on primary sources from the course syllabus and conducting secondary research on their own. In the process, we will work together to craft visual arguments about the different forms of visual culture examined in the class.

###### Throughout the semester we will scaffold this assignment by holding additional technical instruction and tutorials, by viewing and analyzing other video essays as models, and by working in groups to provide feedback and advice on composition, editing, and revision of these projects.

#### <a name="head1"></a>**Phase 1: Ideation and Planning**

In the first phase of this project, students will meet with the instructor for a 1-on-1 conference to briefly to discuss and brainstorm ideas for possible video essays, and to troubleshoot any questions or concerns you may have at this point. This conference will be followed by the submission of a formal proposal identifying a topical focus for their essay, and explaining its relevance to the course.

##### **Instructor Conferences**

Students should come to this meeting prepared to pitch 2-3 possible ideas for video essays. Pitches might be focused around a particular game/game designer or a particular film/filmmaker that you’re interested in, or around a thematic preoccupation or theoretical idea from class discussions (e.g., 'grammars of action'; 'control allegory'; 'mechanisms of percpetion'). Students should also feel free to pitch ideas for video essays that are based in their own reading and gaming experience, rather than rooted in the assigned materials. In our conference, we will discuss practical research considerations such as scope, purpose, and deliverables.

Before attending their conference students should complete the following: 

- **View** the sample video essay [“Frames of Mind” by Jordan Tynes and Maurizio Viano](http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2015/03/12/frames-mind)
- **Read** the short accompanying creator's statement [“A Case for Writing Visually”](http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2015/03/12/frames-mind)

You should leave this instructor conference with a clear idea of the project that you hope to pursue, and be ready to begin working on your proposal.

These conferences will be held during the week of Monday, 02/06. 

You should allow 15-20 minutes to attend your conference.

Students can schedule a conference appointment [**via Canvas**](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/17305/assignments/184200)

##### **Video Essay Proposals**

All students will submit a formal proposal for their portfolio projects by Friday, March 03rd.

Proposals should be no more than 2-3 pages in length (incl. timeline), and must address each of the following three areas:

1. **A description of the student's project choice —** should offer an overview of the student’s choice of project, by clearly indicating the focus of the essay (e.g., theoretical, historical, formal), giving a brief description of the project's intellectual purpose and the scope of its deliverables. **(~250 words)**

2. **A justification of the project's relevance to the course aims and content —** should discuss the relevance of the topical focus and its purpose to our ongoing course conversations regarding video games and narrative cinema. Should mention any relevant primary sources (i.e., films, games), as well as secondary sources (i.e., scholarly books, articles, or essays).**(~250 words)**

3. **A preliminary outline of a plan of work with a timeline for completing the project —** should lay out a feasible and thoughtful plan for undertaking the work necessary to complete the video essay. **(.5-1 pg table/chart)**

These plans need not follow any single format, and in fact, should ideally be tailored to the needs and schedule of the individual who creates them. However, in general they should include provisions for several phases of work including:

- Pre-Production: preliminary research, outlining, story-boarding
- Production: script composition, gameplay capture & film clipping, audio recording
- Post-Production: audio and visual editing, rough cut submission and final revisions

**PLEASE NOTE:** Upon review, students may be asked to revise and resubmit their proposals if any of these areas have not been adequately addressed.

Proposals will be submitted [**via Canvas**](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/17305/assignments/184297)
