### **Video Essay Projects**

###### The capstone assignment for this course is a video essay project that we will screen together as a class at the end of the semester. These essays will showcase our various explorations of, and interventions in, the study of video games and narrative cinema. 

###### Students will use these video essay projects to make original arguments about the interpenetrated histories, forms, and/or genres of video games and narrative cinema, by drawing on primary sources from the course syllabus and conducting secondary research on their own. In the process, we will work together to craft visual arguments about the different forms of visual culture examined in the class.

###### Throughout the semester we will scaffold this assignment by holding additional technical instruction and tutorials, by viewing and analyzing other video essays as models, and by working in groups to provide feedback and advice on composition, editing, and revision of these projects.

#### <a name="head1"></a>**Phase 1: Ideation and Planning**

In the first phase of this project, students will meet with the instructor for a 1-on-1 conference to briefly to discuss and brainstorm ideas for possible video essays, and to troubleshoot any questions or concerns you may have at this point. This conference will be followed by the submission of a formal proposal identifying a topical focus for their essay, and explaining its relevance to the course.

##### **Instructor Conferences**

Students should come to this meeting prepared to pitch 2-3 possible ideas for video essays. Pitches might be focused around a particular game/game designer or a particular film/filmmaker that you’re interested in, or around a thematic preoccupation or theoretical idea from class discussions (e.g., 'grammars of action'; 'control allegory'; 'mechanisms of percpetion'). Students should also feel free to pitch ideas for video essays that are based in their own reading and gaming experience, rather than rooted in the assigned materials. In our conference, we will discuss practical research considerations such as scope, purpose, and deliverables.

Before attending their conference students should complete the following: 

- **View** the sample video essay [“Frames of Mind” by Jordan Tynes and Maurizio Viano](http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2015/03/12/frames-mind)
- **Read** the short accompanying creator's statement [“A Case for Writing Visually”](http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2015/03/12/frames-mind)

You should leave this instructor conference with a clear idea of the project that you hope to pursue, and be ready to begin working on your proposal.

These conferences will be held during the week of Monday, 02/06. 

You should allow 15-20 minutes to attend your conference.

Students can schedule a conference appointment [**via Canvas**](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/17305/assignments/184200)

##### **Video Essay Proposals**

All students will submit a formal proposal for their video essay projects by Friday, March 03rd.

Proposals should be no more than 2-3 pages in length (incl. timeline), and must address each of the following three areas:

1. **A description of the student's project choice —** should offer an overview of the student’s choice of project, by clearly indicating the focus of the essay (e.g., theoretical, historical, formal), giving a brief description of the project's intellectual purpose and the scope of its deliverables. **(~250 words)**

2. **A justification of the project's relevance to the course aims and content —** should discuss the relevance of the topical focus and its purpose to our ongoing course conversations regarding video games and narrative cinema. Should mention any relevant primary sources (i.e., films, games), as well as secondary sources (i.e., scholarly books, articles, or essays).**(~250 words)**

3. **A preliminary outline of a plan of work with a timeline for completing the project —** should lay out a feasible and thoughtful plan for undertaking the work necessary to complete the video essay. **(.5-1 pg table/chart)**

These plans need not follow any single format, and in fact, should ideally be tailored to the needs and schedule of the individual who creates them. However, in general they should include provisions for several phases of work including:

- Pre-Production: preliminary research, outlining, story-boarding
- Production: script composition, gameplay capture & film clipping, audio recording
- Post-Production: audio and visual editing, rough cut submission and final revisions

**PLEASE NOTE:** Upon review, students may be asked to revise and resubmit their proposals if any of these areas have not been adequately addressed.

Proposals will be submitted [**via Canvas**](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/17305/assignments/184297)

#### <a name="head2"></a>**Phase 2: Composition and Production**

In the second phase of the project, students will attend an instructional session at the Media & Design Center at the undergraduate library to familiarize themselves with the video production and editing tools available in the Adobe software suite. Following this session at the MDC, production of the video essays will then commence in earnest. Students will begin gathering appropriate film and gameplay clips, storyboarding their essay projects, and composing a draft of their scripts. This phase will culminate in the submission of a formal progress report.

##### **Instructional Session at the MDC**

Students should come to this session with their laptops ready to use with appropriate software installed. Students should also feel free to bring specific questions about particular video composition techniques (e.g., textual overlay; small multiples; side-by-side; or diagrammatic overlays) that they are interested in incorporating into their video essay projects.

Before attending their conference students should complete the following: 

- **View** the sample video essay [“Special Effectivities” by Ian Bryce Jones](http://mediacommons.org/intransition/special-effectivities)
- **Review** ["Premier Pro Quickstart Guide"](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/ld.php?content_id=67370743)

You should leave this instructional session feeling confident to continue learning to use Adobe Premier through further experimentation and self-guided reference to MDC materials. 

This instructional session will be held during the our normal class time on **Tuesday 03/07** in **UL 205**

##### **Video Essay Progress Reports**

All students will submit a formal progress report for their video essay projects by Friday, April 14th.

Progress Reports should be assembled as a single document (either PDF or word document) and must contain each of the following elements:

1. **Bibliography -** A complete bibliography of all works cited (primary and secondary) in the video essay, formatted according to MLA style.

2. **Media Clip Library -** a link to a shared OneDrive or Google Drive folder containing all film, and gameplay clips to be used in the composition of the video essay. **(NOTE: clips should be of a sufficient cumulative length to compose a 5-7min video)**

3. **Storyboard -** a storyboard file, integrating visual content blocking (media clips), chunked descriptive outline of scripted content to be recorded in voice-over, and any planned additional audio features (e.g., music, sound effects, or audio only clips from film/games). **(~1-3 pages)**

4. **Draft Script —** a complete rough draft of the scripted dialogue that you will incorporate as voice-over for the essay. **(500-800 words)**

For our scripts, we want to maximize depth over breadth. As such, analytical focus is paramount to crafting a effective script. The visual components of your composition should do as much or more argumentative work as your spoken words, (e.g., illustrating key concepts, demonstrating comparative frames, justifying analytical claims). In an essay of this length, scripts should strive for a synthesis of secondary texts and primary examples within the following scope.

**Draft Scripts Should:**
- identify and illustrate 1 observed pattern of textual detail and/or gamic action 
- introduce and explain 1 insight drawn from secondary research
- elaborate and demonstrate 1 theoretical/critical concept

**PLEASE NOTE:** Upon review, students may be asked to hold a follow-up conference with the instructor in order to address any potential bottlenecks, or problems.

Progress Reports will be submitted [**via Canvas**](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/17305/assignments/190454)

#### <a name="head3"></a>**Phase 3: Editing and Revision**

In the final phase of the project, students will assemble a rough cut of their video essay projects, offer constructive feedback to each other through peer review, and engage in iterative composition practices to refine and revise their video essays prior to submission. These activites will be conducted through a series of in-class workshops during weeks 14 and 15.

##### **Rough Cut Assembly Workshop**

Our first editing workshop will take place on Tuesday, April 18th. Students should come to this session with their laptops ready to use with appropriate software installed. In class, students will begin working towards a complete rough cut assembly of their video essay projects. 

**In this session students will:**
- discuss voice over recording logistics, and make plans for recording.
- re-visit and expand work timelines from proposal for final phase.
- begin assembling the rough cut of their video essay.


**By the end of this session students should have:**
- created a new Premier Pro Project for their video essays.
- imported their media library into Premier.
- completed editorial assembly of at least 1 section of the essay (i.e., rough cutting and timing of 90-120 sec.).

There will also be time during this session to review instructor feedback on the progress reports, and schedule time for follow-ups during office hours.

A complete assembled rough cut is due by 12:00PM on Tuesday, April 25th.

Rough Cuts will be submitted [**via Canvas**](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/17305/assignments/197245)

##### **Rough Cut Editing Workshop**

Our second editing workshop will take place on Tuesday, April 25th. Students should come to this session with their complete rough cuts assembled and submitted via canvas. In class, students will work in small groups to view each other's essays and offer peer review feedback for revision and further editing.  

**In this session students will:**
- share progress with their peers, and view peer rough cuts.
- generate insights, both practical and critical, for making iterative editorial changes.
- collaboratively plan a timeline for revision and final submission.

**By the end of this session students should have:**
- viewed and offered critical feedback on at least 3 other video essays by their peers.
- recieved critical feedback on their video essay rough cuts from at least 3 of their peers.
- generated a revision plan outlining specific edits and change notes for final cuts.

There will also be time during this session to schedule time for instructor follow-up during office hours.

A complete revised final cut is due by 11:59PM on Tuesday, May 2nd.

Final Cuts will be submitted [**via Canvas**](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/17305/assignments/197247)
