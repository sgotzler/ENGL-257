### Assignments & Expectations

Below you will find a detailed outline of the assignments and expectations for the course.

#### Viewings and Readings

The foundation of everything we do in this course will be our weekly readings, film viewings and gameplay sessions.

Critical and scholarly sources will be excerpted, and uploaded to Canvas. Several of these readings will be required during the first unit (weeks 1-4), but will become optional once the peer discussion facilitation begins  (weeks 6-8; 10-12). That being said, students are encouraged to examine or skim optional readings at their discretion and according to their inclination, as many may be helpful for developing their video essays. 

Each week a portion of our class time in the Game Room will be used to facilitate extended play of featured titles. To facilitate this, we will work in small groups to play, watch, and discuss these titles at the 5 gaming stations in small groups.

In addition to gameplay sessions held during class time, will be watching nine feature length films—some exceeding 120 minutes in runtime. As such, students will be responsible for viewing the film for each week closely and in its entirety prior to attending class. We will also be regularly viewing video capture of gameplay footage from a variety of games (approx. 10-30min each)—to form the basis of our discussion.
Depending on availability, I may also hold live streams on twitch during select evenings outside of class — in the event that these streaming sessions do occur they would be entirely optional, and participation or viewing of them would have no impact on a student’s grade.

*Expectation and Effort*: Nevertheless, students will be expected to complete a regular weekly viewing load of anywhere between 90-150 minutes of films and gameplay capture footage. While there is no formal mechanism for a participation grade in this course, the best way to ensure that you earn a successful grade, and have the most meaningful learning experience, is to complete the weekly viewings on time and ahead of discussion.

#### Extended Play Journals

In this course, we will be keeping play journals. These journals will be created and maintained on google docs, and are designed to provide a space for students to engage in deliberate guided reflection and practical experimentation. Although we will sample, view, and critically discuss several video games in this course, students will also engage in extended play of 3 titles in particular (i.e., 1 featured game in each unit). These journals are a place for students to document their experiences of critical play, develop insights that may inform their final projects and tackle core writing tasks related to the video essay assignment. 

You will typically have 1 journal entry assigned per week, and they will consist of either free-write exercises, critical reflection prompts, or comparative exercises guided by the films that we watch each week. 

**NOTE:** Students will need to create a google-doc during the first week of the course and share the link with the instructor by 11:59PM ET on THU 01.19.23 (the date of the first journal reflection)—be sure to enable “suggestion” privileges.

*Expectations and Effort*: student effort should not exceed 30 min., but should amount to at least 15 min. per journal entry, and entries should conform to a range between 150-300 words. These journals will be assessed 3 times throughout the semester, once at the conclusion of each unit. Each journal entry will be assessed on an effort/completion basis as follows:
 
- 0=incomplete 
- 3=complete but needs improvement 
- 5=complete and satisfactory effort

#### Weekly *VoiceThread* Responses

Throughout the course we will utilize a software integration in Canvas called VoiceThread to watch and analyze video gameplay footage online. VoiceThread allows students to curate critical annotations on video files and provides a platform for interactive discussion and analysis asynchronously in-between class sessions. We will use these VoiceThread comments as a baseline to guide our group discussions during class time, and to demonstrate certain critical concepts from the readings or film viewings for each week.

VoiceThread responses will be used to engage a wider range of video games in the class than we would otherwise be able to accomplish in-person, and they will also supplement the extended plays of our 3 select titles in the gaming room during class time.

*Expectations and Effort*: Full details for VoiceThread expectations and criteria will be detailed on Canvas.

#### Discussion Facilitation

Once during the semester students will work in small groups (3-4) to take on responsibility for facilitate discussion during a class session. 

Think of this less as a formal presentation, and more as a commitment to extra preparation. So, in that week only you will be responsible for not only keeping up with the 90-150 minutes of viewing, and journaling but also for reviewing 30-45 pp. of additional secondary material pertaining to the critical concepts for that week’s unit, and putting together a plan for discussion (open-ended questions, guiding observations). As a counter-balance, students facilitating discussion will not be required to complete a VoiceThread response that week, though they are welcome to do so if they wish.

*Expectations and Effort*: Students will need to coordinate with their partners and correspond with the instructor in advance (either on email or over zoom) to ensure that prep is going smoothly. Facilitation duties will be assessed 20 pt. Scale, covering: planning, preparation, contribution, and execution. Further expectations/criteria for facilitation will be detailed on canvas, at a future date.

These facilitations will be scheduled for duties corresponding to weeks 6-8 and weeks 10-12 of the class.

**NOTE:** While students are encouraged to sign-up for the week whose material interests them most, they should also think carefully about which week works best for their personal schedule and the workload in their other classes.

#### Pink Time: Self-Directed Mid-Term

In this course, we will utilize a pedagogical tool called “Pink Time” – I’ll say more about this prior to our first engagement with it, but in brief, PINK TIME is a teaching strategy designed to enable self-directed activity that enhances both student engagement and learning outcomes by emphasizing autonomy, mastery, and purpose (it is an approach whose effectiveness is evidence-based, not just hooey!)— https://www.pinktime.org/ 

Each time that we engage in Pink Time, students will produce a brief —and honest—reflection and assessment of their work, and assign themselves a grade. Ideally, these 3 sessions could build organically upon each other and might add up to a coherent experience – though they might diverge as well, and represent several different avenues of exploration which you tried out during the term.

*Expectation and Effort*: What it means in practice, is that 3 times over the course of the semester instead of holding our normal class session, and in lieu of preparing and attending class (i.e., for approximately 3-4 hr.), you will each engage in self-directed learning activity related to video games and narrative cinema. 

For example, exploring related topics that interest you online, conducting further reading in the history and criticism of cinema or game studies, brainstorming creative ideas for video essays, playing a video game and reflecting on your experience, or watching a film closely and a critique or analysis of its formal features—or anything else that you can imagine!—these are just some ideas, the point is that you decide how to invest your time and that you give yourself free reign to be as creative in those pursuits as you wish.

Pink Time sessions will be held in weeks 5, 9, and 13.

#### FINAL: Video Essay Project

The capstone assignment for this course will be a video essay project that we will screen together as a class at the end of the semester and publish online. These essays will showcase our various explorations of, and interventions in, the study of video games and narrative cinema. 

Students will use these video essay project to make original arguments about the interpenetrated histories, forms, and/or genres of video games and narrative cinema, drawing on primary sources drawn from the course syllabus and conducting secondary research on their own. In the process, we will work together to craft visual arguments about the visual media examined in the class.

Throughout the semester we will scaffold this assignment with additional technical instruction and tutorials, by viewing and analyzing other video essays as models, and working in groups to provide feedback and advice on composition, editing, and revision of these projects. 

*Expectation and Effort*: Students will schedule a 1-on-1 conference with their instructor during week 5 to begin brainstorming ideas for their contribution. This meeting will be followed by the submission of a brief, but formal, proposal for their video essay. These proposals should be no more than 2 pages in length and should include: 
- (1) a description of the student’s video essay focus and topic
- (2) a justification of the chosen focus and topic’s relevance to the course aims and content
- (3) a preliminary outline of a plan of work w/timeline for completing the project
 
The finished video essays should be 10-15min in length, must utilize a minimum of 3 secondary sources drawn either from the course syllabus or independent student research, and should engage in analysis of both video games and films as primary sources.

Instruction during weeks 5, 9, 13, and 15 will be dedicated solely to developing these video essay projects. Initial conferences will be conducted in week 5, proposals will be submitted and assessed in week 9, a progress report will be submitted in week 13, and a rough-cut during weeks 14-15. 

Further details re: the video essay project will be published on the Course Website soon.
